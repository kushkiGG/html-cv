    <h3>Profile</h3>

    <p>A Graduate in Computer Games Programming, looking to get his foot in the door of the industry. My course has helped me to build my knowledge in multiple programming languages, understand how to use different engines to create several projects, as well as build upon existing communication skills necessary to be a part of a successful team. As an undergraduate, I worked on various projects using Unity and Unreal engine. This tested and further developed my teamworking skills, taught me how to efficiently code in C++ and C#, in addition to planning and developing multiple single and multiplayer projects for several different platforms including: PC, PlayStation 5 and Android, all of which were delivered under tight schedules. I have a very strong desire to learn and build on my technical and problem-solving skills, and further develop on my experience working as part of a team. I am very versatile, so I would love to expand my skillset, in addition to using my existing skills to be a great asset to the company.</p>
